# Predicting_Poverty
Poverty Prediction by Satellite Images and Deep Learning
## Summary
- This project uses transfer learning to predict poverty (Wealth index) of a sub-Saharan African country, Burundi, in 2010. 
- Regression models are used to predict Wealth index from luminosity of nighttime satellite images, with r-squared of 0.54.
- Gaussian Mixture Model is used to classify the daytime satellite imagery into three classes, based on the luminosity.
- Transfer learning (VGG16, ResNet50, Inception C3) to capture features from daytime satellite imagery and predict poverty, with the 80% accuracy from the best model.
